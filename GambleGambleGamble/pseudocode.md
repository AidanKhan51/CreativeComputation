I did this too just a bit. One part I found went something like this:

Bank: Everyone shares a certain amount of money -> number stored in database. Bets have a maximum of $1000 if in the red?

Blackjack: Cards moving in space, stand is suspended. Calculates random number between 1-10 for each card hit, if over 21 when stand is hit then bust

Dealer: Dealer calculates 3 random numbers, if it’s over 21 it’s a dealer bust

Betting system: Maybe maximum 10% of max bank if in the green can be bet on-top of the $1000 maximum



I hope this isn't graded
